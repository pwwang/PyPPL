# Error handling of processes

You can ask `PyPPL` to terminate, retry or ignore a job that fails to run.  
When a job finishes, it should generate a `job.rc` file containing the return code. When compare with the valid return codes `pXXX.rc`, the error triggered if it is not in `pXXX.rc`. `pXXX.errhow` determines what's next if errors happen. 

- `"terminate"`: when errors happen, terminate the entire pipeline
- `"ignore"`: ignore the errors, continuing run the next process
- `"retry"`: re-submit and run the job again. `pXXX.errntry` defines how many time to retry.

## Set expectations of a process results
You can use commands to check whether you have expected output. For example:
```python
p = Proc ()
p.input = {"input": "1"}
p.script = "echo {{i.input}}"
# check the stdout
p.expect = "grep 1 {{job.outfile}}"
```
