## Writing a plugin to extend the cli

### CLI plugin abstract class

A CLI plugin has to be a subclass of `pipen.cli.CLIPlugin`.

A CLI plugin has to define a `name` property, which also is the sub-command of the plugin.

There are a couple of methods of `pipen.cli.CLIPlugin` to extend for a plugin:

- `__init__(self, parser, subparser)`: initialize the plugin
  It takes the main parser and the subparser of the sub-command as arguments. You can add arguments to the parser or subparser here.
  Check [argx][1] for more information about how to define arguments.

- `parse_args(self)`: parse the arguments
  It takes no arguments. It should parse the arguments and return the parsed arguments (Namespace), which are used to execute the command.
  By default, `self.parser.parse_args()` is called to parse the arguments.

- `exec_command(self, args)`: execute the command
  It takes the parsed arguments as argument. It should execute the command as you wish.

### loading CLI plugins

Like pipen [plugins][2], [templates][3], and [schedulers][4], there are two ways to load the CLI plugins:

1. Use the plugin directly:

    ```python
    from pipen.cli import cli_plugin

    cli_plugin.register(<your plugin>)
    ```

2. Use the entry points with group name `pipen_cli`


## The `profile` subcommand

It is used to list the configurations/profiles in current directory. Run `pipen profile` or `pipen help profile` to get more information.

## The `plugins` subcommand

This subcommand is used to list the plugins for `pipen` itself, templates, scheduler and cli. Run `pipen plugins` or `pipen help plugins` to get more information.

## The `version` subcommand

This command prints the versions of `pipen` and its dependencies.
